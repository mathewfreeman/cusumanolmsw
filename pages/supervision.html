            <p class="subtitle has-text-weight-semibold">I am currently accepting new LL's (BSW and MSW) for supervision. Read on to learn more about my experience. If you think I might be a good fit for you and your work, email me to get started!</p>
            <p>I have been working as a Master's level social worker since 2014 after I finished my graduate degree in social work at the University of Michigan with a clinical focus on children and youth in families. After finishing my education I started my career working in hospice, providing support and resources to patients and their families in the Lansing area.</p>
            <p>Beginning in 2015, I became the Program Coordinator for the Link Volunteer Navigator Program at St. Joseph Mercy Health System. The Link Volunteer Navigator Program trained volunteers to provide resources and support to oncology patients.</p>
            <p>Most recently I work at St. Joseph Mercy Health System as a Nationally Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist providing motivational interviewing support and counseling to oncology patients who are interested in quitting smoking. In this role I provide my team with clinical expertise as the only person with a clinical background. Each of my roles at St. Joseph Mercy have heavily involved program building, maintenance and sustainability.</p>
            <p>In 2018 and 2019 I also taught BSW-level social work courses at Concordia University in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Finally, I have supervised BSW and MSW level social work interns over the years.</p>
            <p>In 2019 I completed my certification in Core Supervision through the Michigan NASW chapter.</p>
            <p>I am a firm believer in the importance of good, empowering and enthusiastic supervision throughout the continuum of your career as a social worker. I aim to provide this support to the social workers whom I supervise.</p>
            <p>I specialize in providing supervision to social workers who are working in volunteer management, oncology, adjustment to illness, grief and loss, substance abuse (with clinical expertise in tobacco specifically), and less conventional social work roles, both micro and macro.</p>
            <p class="subtitle has-text-weight-semibold is-italic">I offer a sliding scale to help make this important part of licensure affordable.</p>
