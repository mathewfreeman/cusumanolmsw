            <p>When most people think of 'equine therapy' they envision some type of equine 'professional' giving a lesson with the client riding a well-broke horse. Often times this therapy is connected to kids or adults with special needs and some level of physical disability. This is one type of horse therapy - it is well evidenced and it does incredible work for the populations that it serves! If this describes what you are looking for, I would be happy to connect you with some really wonderful local programs that offer this important type of therapy!</p>
            <p>Unlike this framework, equine-assisted psychotherapy is done through 100% ground work. My clients never ride. Instead my equine partner assists me in facilitating metaphor and therapeutic connection for my clients. Even though you wonâ€™t ride, you will have hands on time with the horses at whatever level you are comfortable!</p>
            <p>I am currently available to travel and provide these services to clients with their own horses. Contact me at jordan@cusumano<!-- -->lmsw.<!-- -->com or call/text (734<!-- -->) 4<!-- -->89-15<!-- -->18 for more information on how to get started with this specialized therapy!</p>

            <p>Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy is different in a few ways:</p>  
            <ul>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">The Eagala Model was developed and is used to serve patients who are seeking mental health treatment. It is evidenced to significantly benefit people of all ages who are struggling with a wide range of concerns including but not limited to anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress disorder, trauma, abuse, autism, bullying at school, social anxiety, grief, and more.</li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">This work is considered a form of experiential therapy (compared to more traditional models of therapy such as psychoanalytic therapy or talk therapy). While we will talk during your session, much of the time will be spent with the horses.</li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">The model requires a team of an equine 'professional' (someone with at least 6,000 hours of experience working hands on with horses), a mental health professional (master's level social worker, psychiatrist, licensed counselor) and at least one horse.</li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">The work is done completely on the ground - you will not ride the horses. This is why EAGALA is the safest form of activity with horses. This approach ensures the physical as well as mental safety and wellbeing for you as well as our horse partners.</li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">The model is solution-oriented, meaning that as an Eagala certified facilitator we believe that clients have the best solutions for themselves; it is the facilitator team's job to help draw these solutions out for the client through their time spent with the horses.</li>
            </ul>
