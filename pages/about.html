                        <p>I received my Master’s Degree in Social Work from the University of Michigan and my Bachelor’s Degrees in Social Work and Journalism from Eastern Michigan University. Before starting my own Private Practice, I worked for five years at the Cancer Center at St. Joseph Mercy Health System. During my time there I held multiple roles including, managing a volunteer program with cancer survivors and local college students who provided support and information to cancer patients and their families on local psychosocial support resources, assisted patients and their families in completing Advance Directives and counseling oncology patients who were interested in quitting nicotine/tobacco use. Before this I worked as a Hospice Social Worker for McLaren Hospice. Currently I am also a contract therapist with a group practice in Ann Arbor, Lotus Consulting. At Lotus I provide traditional psychotherapy to clients of all backgrounds but I primarily serve college-age students and graduate/PhD students attending the University of Michigan. In addition to my work experience I am also certified with EAGALA as a Equine-Assisted Psychotherapist both as a Mental Health Provider as well as an Equine Specialist. My other certifications include Nationally Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing and more. I am a student of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Attachment Theory, and Shame and Vulnerability theories as well.</p>
                        <p>I bring this wealth of knowledge and experience to every client I have the privilege of working with. In addition I humbly believe that all of this is set down alongside YOUR unique experiences and feelings. I tailor my approach to therapy to the unique needs, personalities and goals of my clients.</p>
                        <p>Whether I am working with you via teletherapy or at the barn with my equine co-therapists, my approach is centered around empathy, growth and providing a safe, comfortable space for my clients to process their lives. My first experiences, personally, seeking this sanctuary began in my teenage years. I found it at the barn - and my counselor was my Morgan horse, Ace. Since those days I continue to experience my deepest, most vulnerable and rich experiences with horses. My goal is to provide you with the same peace and calm that I’ve found by experiencing animal connection. Whether you have experiences with horses or not, my co-therapists are available to offer healing, kindness and joy.</p>
                        <p>My areas of specialty include personal growth and development, grief, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and tendencies, lack of motivation, mood, secondary trauma, adjustment to illness, life transitions, self-care and awareness, making healthy choices and life-style changes, and general wellness.</p>
                        <p class="subtitle has-text-weight-semibold">I look forward to meeting you!</p>
