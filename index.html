            <p>One of the bravest things any of us can do is reach out for support. Whether you’ve been considering starting therapy for a while to process your past, present or fears of the future or you have seen a therapist before and are interested in continuing the work of self-discovery and growth, I would be honored to meet you and walk alongside you on your journey.</p>
            <p>My approach is centered around empathy, growth and providing a safe, comfortable space for my clients to process their lives. My first experiences, personally, seeking this sanctuary began in my teenage years. I found it at the barn - and my counselor was my Morgan horse, Ace. Since those days I continue to experience my deepest, most vulnerable and rich experiences with horses. My goal is to provide you with the same peace and calm that I’ve found by experiencing animal connection. Whether you have experiences with horses or not, my co-therapists are available to offer healing, kindness and joy.</p>
            <p>My areas of specialty include personal growth and development, grief, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and tendencies, lack of motivation, mood, secondary trauma, adjustment to illness, life transitions, self-care and awareness, making healthy choices and life-style changes, and general wellness.</p>
            <p>Look around my website, follow me on Facebook and Instagram and reach out to me by email to set up our first session together!</p>

You will be asked to take your temperature when you arrive for your appointment and sign an attestation that you have no experienced symptoms of Covid in the past two weeks. All brushes, halters, lead ropes and commonly touched services will be cleaned prior to your arrival and upon the completion of your session. You will have the option to wear a mask if you feel comfortable doing so - we will maintain a socially distanced 6 feet apart as much as possible as well. These policies and procedures may change as time goes on so please stay up-to-date on any emails that come your way before each session.</p>
